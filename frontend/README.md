# Frontend Technical Specification

- Create a static website that serves a HTML resume.

## Resume Format Considerations

I live in Ireland and usually downloadable Resumes don't contain 
personally identifiable information.  However, in a personal website
some people do show personal information.

## HTML Adjustments
- We will be applying mobile styling to the website, so will include 
the viewport meta tag:

width=device-width

so mobile styling scales normally.

- We will extract styles into their own stylesheet when happy with the 
HTML markup

- We will simplify our HTML markup CSS selector to be as minimal as possible.

- For the HTML page I will use soft tab two spaces (re. Ruby standard tab format).
